I've thought about writing this blog post for quite a long time. I've thought even more about how I could do it justice when such strong emotions are involved. Emotions for something that, had you told me several years ago, I'd probably have shrugged it off. I'm generally pretty tight lipped when it comes to my emotions (which is a problem), not because of some masculine identity issue I might have or fear of ridicule or any such nonsense. No, the only conclusion I can come to is that it hits me in places I didn't and couldn't know would exist several years ago.

Stepping back, the first episode of [The Adventure Zone](http://www.maximumfun.org/adventure-zone/ep-1-here-there-be-gerblins-chapter-one) came out in December of 2014. That year, in particular, was really hard on my wife and I in so many different ways. It wasn't for naught, though. No, of course not, far from it in fact. How could it be when it was also one of the most beautiful and fulfilling times of our lives due to our first child, our daughter, being born only a few weeks before its start. A month after The Adventure Zone began, in January of 2015, we would also find out that our son was on his way.

So a lot was going on as 2014 gave way to 2015.

And that's where The Adventure Zone comes into play in our lives.

It feels ridiculous even bringing what is ostensibly just a D&D podcast into a conversation about how our lives were changing in such huge ways around that time, but it has its place in a way I couldn't see then. In a way I've only been able to glimpse in the fullness of time.

The Adventure Zone was an anchor for my wife and I.

An anchor in a time of peace, of fear, of laughter, of chaos, of high emotions of every conceivable type. An anchor that grounded us every couple weeks in a story of three friends who slowly become family in a time when we were also building our own family.

A rule quickly emerged in our household soon after the show grabbed us:

*You shall not listen without the other person present, for this time is sacrosanct.*

And so it was. Sometimes this meant, as things got busy, we would wait a week or longer to listen to an episode, avoiding spoilers at all costs. That's more difficult than it seems considering how quickly the fan art community reacted to each episode (pretty sure people were posting artwork as they were finishing the episode...). But we always made it work. We waited and listened to every episode together, without fail.

And we grew, just as they did. Our family, the characters in the show, and the brothers writing and playing the characters we grew to love so, so very much.
