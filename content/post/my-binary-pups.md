I haven't really posted much that's too personal on my blog yet, instead opting for more techy topics. I thought earlier it'd be nice to post some pictures of our puppies, Ichi and Zero, and realized I could split the uprights and hit both personal and techy in one post!

Before we bought our house, I had always wanted to have a dog named Zero. I made an offhand joke once to my wife that if I did ever get a dog named Zero, I'd have to also have one named Ichi (the number one in Japanese) so that I could have binary dogs.

Well, the day we bought our house my wife and parents surprised me with two Shiba puppies. It was a total shock and I couldn't have been more happy and surprised.

Though they love to get in the trash and tear things up (you should have [seen our baseboards](/img/Baseboards.jpg) on our beautiful new house...), they've been great dogs for our family. We even had an album we posted about them [go semi viral](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2532850/A-babys-best-friend-How-Zero-adorably-protective-Shiba-Inu-watches-owners-two-week-old-daughter-times.html) when we had our daughter. Just stay away from the comments if you go searching... They're exactly what you'd expect.
